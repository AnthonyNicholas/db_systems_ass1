/*Task 2: MongoDB
 * You are required to load the data into MongoDB. In your report:
 * explain how have you chosen to structure the data inserted in MongoDB
 * provide details of the time taken to load the data (The mongoimport is one utility will provide such information). Please note that 
 * a naive import into a flat structure in Mongodb will not accrue you a great mark. You need to analyse the data and consider 
 * appropriate ways to structure the data and then using any scripting, programming or other tools to format the data accordingly.
 * Postgraduate students only: What alternative way or ways could you have organised the data when storing in MongoDB, 
 * and what advantages or disadvantages would these alternative designs have?
